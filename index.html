      <h2>what are Medicine?</h2>
      <P>Medicenes are chemicals or compounds ased to cure, halt , or prevent disease; ease sypmtoms or help in the
        diagonosis of illnesses. Advaces in medivibes have ebabvled doctors to cure maby diseases abd save lives. These
        days, medivibes come from a variety of sources. Maby were developed from substances found in nature and even
        today many are extracted from plants. Some medicines are made in labs by mixing together a numver of chemicals.
        Others, like penicillin are byproducts of organisms such as fongus and a few are even biologically engineered by
        inserting genes into bacteria that make them produce the desired substance. When we think about taking
        medivines, we often think of polls. But medicines can be delivered in many ways, such as:
      <ul class="indiv">
        <li>liquids that are allowed.
        </li>
        <li>Drops that are put into ears or eyes.</li>
        <li>Creams, gels, or ointments that are rubbed onto the skin.</li>
        <li>Inhalers(like nasal sprays or asthme inhalers)</li>
      </ul>
      No medicine can be sold unless it has first been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
      meakers of the medicine do tests on all new medicines and send the results to the FDA. The FDA allows bew
      medicines to be used only if they work and if they are safe enough. When a medicine's benefits outweigh it's kmown
      risks, the FDA usually approves the sale of the drug. The FDAcan withdraw a medicine from the market at any time
      if it later is found to cause harmful side effects.
